# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo contains the following required files for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:
1) a tidy data set ("tidydata.txt") as described below. 
2) a link to a Github repository with the run_analysis.R script for performing the analysis.
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4) README.md in the repo with your scripts. This explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

1. run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
